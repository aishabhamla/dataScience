In the era of big data, social media applies many information methods. In this project, we will be provided a data set with tweets related to the weather. With these tweets, our group will create a program that will read these tweets and analyze them to see what sort of weather the tweet references and will figure out when the weather occurred (past, present, or future). This project is to create a software that will analyze a set of tweets which will be given to the software itself and from there it will determine if the weather is one of the three sentiments (positive, neutral, or negative) and then tell if the referenced weather in the tweet occurred in the past, present, and or future. The main objective of this project is to be able to assign certain labels to tweets based on the weather information that we can learn from them. This is clearly a classification problem so approaches like decision trees are being taken into consideration since they fit our needs. Results are going to be classified quantitatively since we want to get the minimum amount of error possible when utilizing the testing dataset. The performance metric utilized will be how many labels are accurately assigned (performance reduced by incorrect assignation or lack of assignation of labels).
 
What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting? 
  The problem we will be looking at is whether or not if softwares can use social media (in this case Twitter) to predict what the weather is and can it tell when has it happened or will it happen.
What data will you use? If you are collecting new data, how will you do it? 
  It will use the dataset of tweets provided by the competition.
